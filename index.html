            <p class="left-width">Who cares if one more light goes out,<br>
                Well, I do.(One more light)<br>
                Remember all the sadness and frustration<br>
                Let it go, let it go.(Iridescent)<br>
                Don't resent me,when you are feeling empty<br>
                Keep me in your memory,leave out all the rest.<br>
                Leave out all the rest.
